# Notes

- VPN would not let me connect to github, SIGH
- used this thoughtbot article to setup webpack, babel, react
  - https://robots.thoughtbot.com/setting-up-webpack-for-react-and-hot-module-replacement

- issue with babel loader, missing babel-core
  - from github: `npm install babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev
`
  - also: `npm-install babel-preset-react`
