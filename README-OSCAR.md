# Oscar Interview Project Guidelines
---
## Overview
The Oscar Interview Project is meant to test your skills as an engineer.
Please choose **one** of the following projects to complete. This project should
take approximately 4 hours and should include everything mentioned in
this document.

## Projects

### Finding Care
Build a tool to help someone find the right facility to receive a flu shot, leveraging the userâ€™s current location and a the NYC OpenData API.

### Green Spaces
Build a tool to visualize the tree population of NYC and understand the current state of geographic coverage. The user should be able to filter results based on species, health, etc. and should use the NYC OpenData: Street Tree Census.

## Final deliverable
When you have completed the challenge, please send us a link to the hosted code
(Github, Stash, etc.). Please **do not** send us a zip of the entire project.
As part of the project, you should include a `README.md` file with the
following information:

1. Your Name, Github Profile URL, and a link to the project.
2. What problem you are solving and how is your solution solving the problem?
3. What were some technical decisions you made and why did you make them?
 What were the benefits/costs?
4. If you were to continue working on the project, how would you imp

## Review process
Your project will be judged by our engineers under the following criteria:

- **Code style**: Does the structure of the application and how you separate different sections of your code make sense? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines and does it stay consistent throughout the project? Do your choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application? Are technical tradeoffs explained?
- **Simplicity**: Is the code easy to understand? Can another engineer pick up your code and edit it easily? Does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution?
- **UX**: Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing? Is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the API intuitive?
